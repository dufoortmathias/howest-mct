<ul>
<li>Provides connections to hosts in a local network</li>
<li>Typically connected using Layer 2 switches</li>
<li>If message is destined for a local host: message remains local</li>
<li>If message is destined for a different network: message is passed up to the distribution layer</li>

<p>Uses a 3 step process to discover and store the MAC-address of a host on the local network when only the IPv4 address is known.</p>
<ol>
<li>The sending hosts creates and sends a frame addressed to a broadcast MAC address. Contained in the frame: the IPv4 address of the intended destination host</li>
<li>Each host on the network receives the broadcast frame. The host with the matching IPv4 address sends its MAC address back to the original sending host.</li>

<h3 id="dividing-the-network">Dividing the network</h3>
<p>Many ways to divide a network, based on different criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broadcast containment:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Routers in the distribution layer can limit broadcasts to the local network where they need to be heard. Too many hosts connected to the same local network can generate excessive broadcast traffic and slow down the network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Security requirement:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Routers in the distribution layer can seperate and protect certain groups of computers where confidential information resides.</li>
<li>Routers can also hide the addresses of internal computers from the outside world to help prevent attacks, and control who can get into or out of the local network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Physical locations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Routers in the distribution network can be used to interconnect local networks at various locations of an organization that are geographically seperated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Logical grouping:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Routers in the distribution layer can be used to logically group users, such as departments within a company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="routing">Routing</h3>
<p>= The process of identifying the best path to a destination.</p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting a path
<ul>
<li>Router creates a routing table containing all locally-connected and remote networks and the interfaces that connect to them.</li>
<li>Routers use their routing tables and forward packets to either a directly connected network containing the actual destination host, or to another router on the path to reach the destination host.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Building the tables
<ul>
<li>Routers build their routing tables by first adding their locally connected networks, and then learning about other networks using routing protocols.</li>
